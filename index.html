			<p>Hi, I'm Logan Flansaas (he/him). I'm a 3rd year AGPM major who loves to play video, card, and board games of all kinds. I'm a big fan of fantasy and sci-fi themes and stories, and have spent thousands of hours reading books, the internet, and day dreaming up my own stories. I have a deep appreciation for technology and the potential progress and propserity it can bring society, though I am also still aware of the challenges and dangers new technology can pose when used unethically. I have some intermediate programming experience with Java, C++, and Python as well as some Javascript, and I am comfortable with coding and fairly computer savvy. I also have some experience with game design, art and graphic design, and 3d modeling. I aspire to be a successful game developer some day, or at least find a related career that I can tolerate and make a living off of.</p>
