			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p> We did not have much of challenge completing the lab. The conditonals present were very simple to write given our combined programming knowledge, and the modulus operator is one of the very first things we learned in programming classes. The assignment was otherwise very similar to Lab 7, which made completing this lab easier.</p>

		<div id="problems">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> We initially couldn't get the name input field to return its value for a while, which caused our program to not output anything when clicked the submit button. We resolved the issue by moving the name variable declaration into the button click function.</p>
